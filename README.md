# PseudoQ v2.1

### Sudoku is really fun -- but it's also really hard, in fact, it is NP hard. 

This does not merely concern the solving of actual Sudoku puzzles, but also the grid architecture as a whole, as observed e.g. in the attempt to generate a random (valid) Grid. This repository is part of a side project of mine called "The syntax of Sudoko grids" (some might prefer the label 'geometry' instead of 'syntax', but I'm a linguist and I call the shots here!). It provides the basic architecture to instantiate, generate, manipulate and permute Sudoku grids.
